        "* Strongest model in the 1-20B parameter range models\n",
        "* Does decently in code-related tasks\n",
        "* Uses Windowed attention, allowing to push to 200k tokens of context if using Rope (needs 4 A10G GPUs for this)\n",

        "* **PRO and Enterprise API:** Hugging Face provides an open API for all its PRO users.  Subscribing to the Pro Inference API costs $9/month and allows you to experiment with many large models, such as Llama 2 and SDXL. Read more about it [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/inference-pro).\n",
